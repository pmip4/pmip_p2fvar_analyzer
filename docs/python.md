# Python Notebooks

Python scripts ahave been written as notebooks. The choice of notebooks allows documentation and outputs to be stored with the scripts. Most of the analysing and plotting processes in python have been written into functions, and they are stored in different scripts according to their purposes respectively. Each notebook is named according to its purpose and usage, with detailed documentations available in the script. These scripts all start with a set of five functions to collect the names of available models that have the variable in the experiment and their corresponding directory and filenames respectively and return a dictionary storing these information as "’model_name’:’directory/filename’", in which function 'identify_ensemble_members' requires running 'find_experiment_ensemble_members.bash' in bin directory to identify available ensemble members (i.e. model names) whose simulations have the target variable in the experiment.
